    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
        Cyber security is the process of protecting your technology against cyber attacks. 
        This is done in a variety of ways, such as choosing strong passwords, not opening links 
        that seem suspicious, and backing up any important data that you have. A person working 
        in cybersecurity prevents and responds to threats against computers and other technology 
        and helps to recover data from any attacks that may have occured.
